## About the Massacre
On Sunday April 2nd, 2023 a CIA team led by Annie Jacobsen stormed Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, Kentucky near the end of the morning worship services. 

Prior to entering the church the CIA deployed and activated cellular network equipment which would cause all cell phones in the nearby area to automatically connect to it (a “cell on wheels”). 

A few men entered the rear of the church and blocked the two rear exits, meanwhile approximately fifty men entered the church through the main entrance. 

With all exits blocked and cellphones unable to call actual 911 due to the setup of the cellular equipment the CIA brought, the invading force began the systematic murder of everyone inside. 

The Rev. Dr. Felix G. Williams, III was tortured extensively by several in the group who demanded to know about church operations and his family relationships and finally murdered. 

The CIA then setup a charade church called Mount Calvary Missionary Baptist Church, Inc. and began producing videos to portray normalcy at the church using actors who resembled pastors and members of the church. The CIA has opened the church week after week in an effort to murder any remaining members or those with a relationship with the church that show up. 

The CIA also began holding funerals to eliminate any in the surrounding area who called looking for people who had been previously killed the church. The funerals were held solely to kill any mourners who came. 

### Warning
No one should call or visit Mount Calvary Baptist Church or a church by any other name on Todds Road until they have seen this coverage on the local and national news channels. 

It is recommended that any person who feels the need to report a person missing that was known to be going to a church on Todds Road to delay making the report due a government cover up. The CIA is actively identifying and killing anyone who makes a report of a missing person for a person killed at the church or in the coverup. 

The church will not be having any Sunday worship or Wednesday Bible study services, and no funeral or wedding will be held at the church for the foreseeable future. Anyone at the church prior to the press conference is not authorized to be there and not affiliated with the Mount Calvary that owns the property, but the CIA. 

## About this Repository 
This repository is focused on Mount Calvary Baptist Church on Todds Road in Lexington due to its maintainers long relationship with the church and family relationship with the pastor. Other churches on Todds Road we cannot speak for, but fear they have become part of the massacre turned genocide and cover up by the US government and CIA. 

This repository was setup in a way that it could not be deleted, due to the way the MCBCMF account was created and secured it is now impossible for us to update the topmost description.  The massacre and other related church tasks have been assigned to [the Servants of the Creator](https://github.com/theServants) by the Creator. 

**The Servants’ fork of this repository is the only one that updates this vault copy and the only one anyone should trust—-pray about it as with everything regarding the Mount Calvary Baptist Church Massacre.**

However we encourage everyone to clone and fetch/pull **this** repository often. The more copies of this repo there are the harder it is for the government to keep this quiet. 

## About Mission 23
The Creator’s Mission # 23 for Life on Earth was intended, as all previous missions have been, to help life continue on this planet. Objectives for the Servants of the Creator during the mission included: eradicating all disease, all cancers, and cardiovascular issues in human beings. 

After Gilead Sciences discovered an HIV+ patient had been cured by a single-dose treatment given to him by a servant of the Creator and his friend to prove its effectiveness, Gilead Sciences paid (a front company of) the CIA to have both killed. 

The CIA unable to kill the Creator’s servant killed his entire family and practically all of his friends and any associates they identified. 

The Creator’s servant, born Kelvin Eugene Williams, is now the only living member and interim pastor of Mount Calvary Baptist Church of Lexington, Kentucky.

# Ringing of the Bell
The Creator is now about to “ring the bell.”  

Scientists have often said that a very strong earthquake will ring Earth like a bell.  These earthquakes are intended to _shine a light_ on a horrible, unnecessary tragedy that gave way to the massacre of a church during the height of its Sunday  worship hour, a massacre that has since been repeated, and the coverup operation that has spawned a genocide. 

Regardless of how much work folks have done to get the word out and widely reported for your safety, the federal government and federal law enforcement agencies are still putting pressure on the Commonwealth of Kentucky's attorney and law enforcement to turn a blind eye to the actions of the CIA. The CIA continues to kill in the very place that people go to and expect to be the safest and closest to God, who is none other than, the Creator.  

With the genocide’s death toll increasing daily and the CIA along with the federal government pressuring law enforcement agencies and the media in the Commonwealth to stay quiet, the Creator has decided to ring the bell.    

In addition to showing how displeased He is, the Creator is also honoring lives that have cut short in response to a set of "cures" (some His current objectives) that should have let all of these lives go on for far more years than 99% of the human population believe is even possible.  The way He designed and wants them to be lived. 

# Earthquakes
The order and intensity of the bell ringing will go:

## Orr Chapel Quake
This earthquake’s epicentre will be located  in Sandy Hook, TN (the former unincorporated city near, now neighborhood of Mount Pleasant) in Maury county. The Rogers & Crawley family farms. 

This will be a large earthquake for the CIA’s destruction of Orr Chapel ([Google Maps](https://goo.gl/maps/XMMdNdpGjU3SMMKQ8)) and the murder of all of it’s identified members. 

This quake also recognises Micah’s slain family and his family’s graveyard that was destroyed, both by or at the direction of the CIA.

This minor quake will also be to recognize the lives lost in Jessamine county, mostly Micah’s friends, throughout the larger tragedy.
